# pyfolio

**Project Overview**  
`pyfolio` is a portfolio project designed to practice and learn full-stack Python development. While intentionally overengineered, it serves as a hands-on opportunity to explore best practices, domain-driven design (DDD), and microservice architecture. The project adopts a monorepo structure, combining frontend and backend code in a single repository.

**Key Features**  
- **Frontend**: Built with HTMX and Tailwind CSS for simplicity and interactivity.  
- **Backend**: Powered by FastAPI, leveraging modern Python frameworks and tools.  
- **Architecture**: Microservices with a focus on scalability and maintainability.  
- **CI/CD**: Automated workflows using GitHub Actions and Docker.  
- **Hosting**: Deployed on AWS with infrastructure managed via Terraform.
